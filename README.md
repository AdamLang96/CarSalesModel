<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="cars.gif" alt="Logo" width="800" height="500">

This GitHub repository serves as the home for [CarCollectorPricing.com](http://CarCollectorPricing.com). The primary goal of this project is to gather comprehensive data [CarsandBids.com](https://carsandbids.com/) and utilize this data to train a predictive model that can estimate car sales prices. Whether you're a car enthusiast, a data scientist, or simply interested in predictive modeling, this project offers valuable insights into the world of automotive auctions and machine learning.

Car auctions are a crucial marketplace for both buyers and sellers in the automotive industry. Buyers often seek opportunities to purchase vehicles at competitive prices, while sellers aim to maximize their returns. Accurate price predictions can significantly aid in these endeavors. This project was born out of the desire to harness the power of data science and machine learning to provide valuable pricing guidance to both buyers and sellers in the car auction ecosystem.
